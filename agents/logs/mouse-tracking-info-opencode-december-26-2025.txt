#The reason of this is that i lost a precious conversation 
that i couldn't save in time due to clickng control + s in a opencode conversation

## Subject: How to prevent and recover from Ctrl+S mouse tracking issue in OpenCode

## Conversation Summary:
User accidentally triggered mouse tracking mode in OpenCode TUI by pressing Ctrl+S, which caused the terminal to track mouse activity. In an attempt to escape this confusing mode, the user deleted the conversation by clicking the trash can icon, losing a previous important conversation.

## What Ctrl+S Does in OpenCode:
- Triggers session export/save functionality
- Activates mouse tracking mode where terminal follows cursor
- Can be disorienting and make the interface feel "broken"

## Emergency Recovery Keys (Safe - Won't Delete Chat):
- **Esc** - Exits mouse tracking mode, returns to normal chat
- **Ctrl+C** - Interrupts current operation, keeps conversation intact  
- **Ctrl+X** then **h** - Opens help menu, conversation remains
- **Ctrl+X** then **q** - Quits entire application (ends session)

## Prevention Options:

### Option 1: Disable Ctrl+S Keybinding (Recommended)
Create `opencode.json` in project root:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",
  "keybinds": {
    "session_export": "none"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Remap to Different Keybind
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json", 
  "keybinds": {
    "session_export": "ctrl+shift+s"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Terminal-Level Prevention
Configure terminal to intercept Ctrl+S before reaching OpenCode

### Option 4: Global Config
Create `opencode.json` in user home directory for system-wide protection

## Important Notes:
- Emergency keys (except Ctrl+X q) DO NOT delete conversations
- Deletion only occurs when clicking trash can icon
- Mouse tracking mode is a documented TUI behavior
- OpenCode doesn't maintain local conversation history by default (privacy feature)

## Implementation Priority:
1. Immediate: Create project-level opencode.json to disable Ctrl+S
2. Long-term: Consider if export functionality should be remapped
3. Backup: Learn escape keys for emergency recovery

## Safe Export/Share Commands:
- `/export` - Export conversation to markdown (Ctrl+X x)
- `/share` - Create shareable link (Ctrl+X s)
- `/sessions` - View session management (Ctrl+X l)
