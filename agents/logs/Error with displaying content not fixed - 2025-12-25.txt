Error with displaying content not fixed - 2025-12-25
===============================================

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed:

### ✅ Issue 1: Syntax Error in Exercises.jsx
**Problem**: Malformed code structure with misplaced closing braces at lines 300-303
**Fix**: Corrected the object structure and closing braces in the fetchPersonalRecords function
**File**: C:\Users\dell pc\Documents\Multimedia\2025-2026\DEV5\wdm-YounesEHB2023\images\frontend\src\components\Exercises.jsx

**Original problematic code:**
```javascript
			data.records.forEach(record => {
				if (!recordsMap[record.exerciseId]) {
					recordsMap[record.exerciseId] = {
						exerciseId: record.exerciseId,
						exerciseName: record.exerciseName,
						muscleGroup: record.muscleGroup,
						weight: record.weight,
						reps: record.reps,
						volume: record.volume,
						duration: record.duration
};
	};
}
				}
			});
```

**Fixed code:**
```javascript
			data.records.forEach(record => {
				if (!recordsMap[record.exerciseId]) {
					recordsMap[record.exerciseId] = {
						exerciseId: record.exerciseId,
						exerciseName: record.exerciseName,
						muscleGroup: record.muscleGroup,
						weight: record.weight,
						reps: record.reps,
						volume: record.volume,
						duration: record.duration
					};
				}
			});
```

### ❌ Issue 2: Backend Server Port Conflicts  
**Problem**: Multiple ports (5000, 3000, 4000, 8080, 9999, 6001, 12345) are already in use
**Status**: Cannot resolve due to Docker/WSL processes occupying most ports
**Processes found occupying ports:**
- PID 58996: com.docker.backend.exe (occupying 5000, 5173, 8081, 27017)
- PID 46612: wslrelay.exe (occupying 5000, 5173, 8081, 27017)
- PID 48944: occupying 9999
- PID 13176: occupying 8090

**Ports attempted:**
- 5000 - Failed (Docker)
- 3000 - Failed (Occupied)
- 4000 - Failed (Occupied) 
- 8080 - Failed (Occupied)
- 9999 - Failed (Occupied)
- 6001 - Failed (Occupied)
- 12345 - Failed (Occupied)

**Frontend API configuration updated multiple times:**
- Changed from: http://localhost:5000
- To: http://localhost:5001
- To: http://localhost:3000
- To: http://localhost:8080
- To: http://localhost:4000
- To: http://localhost:9999
- To: http://localhost:6001
- To: http://localhost:12345

## Issues Remaining to Investigate:
1. **Backend 500 Error**: The /api/workouts/records endpoint is returning 500 errors
2. **Database Connection**: MongoDB connection string is being logged but we need to verify it's working
3. **Docker/WSL Port Conflicts**: Need to resolve or work around the port occupation issues

## Browser Errors Found:
1. **React/Babel Syntax Error**: 
   - File: /app/src/components/Exercises.jsx:303:4
   - Message: Unexpected token, expected ","
   - Location: Lines 300-303 (fixed)

2. **500 Internal Server Error**:
   - URL: :5173/src/components/Exercises.jsx:1
   - Message: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
   - Root cause: Backend server not running due to port conflicts

## Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Fixed the syntax error in Exercises.jsx
2. ⚠️ Backend port conflicts need resolution - you may need to stop Docker/WSL services or use a different approach
3. 🔄 Frontend is now running on http://localhost:5173

## Code Changes Made:

### 1. Exercises.jsx - Fixed syntax error
- Removed misplaced closing braces
- Properly structured the recordsMap object creation
- Ensured proper function closure

### 2. API Configuration Updates
- Backend server.js: Updated port from config.port to hardcoded ports (5001, 3000, 4000, 8080, 9999, 6001, 12345)
- Frontend api.js: Updated API_BASE_URL to match backend port attempts

### 3. Backend Configuration
- Updated config/index.js to use port 5001 as default
- Modified server.js to use hardcoded port values

## Current Status:
- Frontend: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5173
- Backend: ❌ Not running (port conflicts)
- Syntax Error: ✅ Fixed
- API 500 Error: ❌ Still occurring due to backend not running

## Next Steps Needed:
1. Resolve Docker/WSL port conflicts OR
2. Use alternative deployment approach OR
3. Find an available port not occupied by system services
4. Test the /api/workouts/records endpoint once backend is running
5. Verify MongoDB database connection and PersonalRecord model functionality

## Files Modified:
- images/frontend/src/components/Exercises.jsx (syntax fix)
- images/frontend/src/utils/api.js (port updates)
- images/backend/src/server.js (port updates)
- images/backend/src/config/index.js (port default change)

Generated: 2025-12-25
Status: Partially Fixed - Syntax error resolved, backend port conflicts remain
